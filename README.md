The project involves analyzing images of bookshelves, detecting individual book spines, and organizing the books on virtual shelves. 
It uses computer vision techniques such as line detection, clustering, and color analysis to detect individual book spines. 
The book spines are then sorted by color in several ways (1D-PCA, 2D-PCA, Hue).
